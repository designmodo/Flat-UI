            <a href="https://designmodo.com/flat" target="_blank">Flat UI</a>
            is a beautiful theme for <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.
            We have redesigned many of its components to look flat in every pixel.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the most part, it is very simple to use. However, to be able
            to make some form elements and others look exactly how we want,
            we ended up using some JS plugins, which requires a bit more effort
            to integrate within your project.

          <h3>How to Use It?</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="demo-content demo-content-article">
          <p>
            Since Flat UI is built on top of Bootstrap as a theme, you can use it in your <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a> project.
            We did not modify any line of Bootstrap, so you will be safe using Flat UI in your ongoing project
            (unless you hacked it yourself!) :)
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide you with the CSS and the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> sources.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Using CSS is as easy as dropping <code>dist/css/flat-ui.css</code> into your project folder and
              including it in your template/html page:
              <code>&lt;link href="dist/css/flat-ui.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Use Sass if you want to modify/extend Flat UI in your project. It is built just like Bootstrap, so
              you won't find a big difference.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The easiest way to start is to use our start-up template (from <code>/dist</code> folder) where all the files are already included
            and ready to use (The JS plugins are included, but not initialized. You will have to initialize them as needed).

            Let's go through this list:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>app/styles/</strong> &mdash; is where source SASS files are located.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>modules/</code> is where the components themselves are.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>mixins/</code> useful utilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>flat-ui-pro.scss</code> links everything into one single bundle.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>_mixins.scss</code> helps automate things.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>_variables.scss</code> is where all the default variables are.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>dist/</strong> &mdash; the compiled Flat UI boilerplate template. If you like everything and you don't want
            to change the look of our components, it is better to use version. This is the easiest
            way to start using Flat UI.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>dist/css/</strong> Flat UI CSS and minified version.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>dist/fonts/</strong> &mdash; local version of Lato and icon font. When integrating this into your project, make sure you
            copy all the font files correctly. You might want to change/add some glyphs. If so, open
            <a href="http://icomoon.io/app">IcoMoon</a> and import <code>selection.json</code>(<code>/font/glyphicons/</code>)
            there to make all glyphs editable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>dist/scripts/</strong> &mdash; we have tried hard to make all our components look truly "flat." In order to do
            so we have used some JS plugins. Most of them are well known, while some of them are not. The most JS-ified
            components are the form components (checkboxes, radios, switches, selects…), since it is not currently possible
            to style them identically in all browsers. Look at <code>docs/assets/js/application.js</code> for integration
            examples.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>docs/</strong> &mdash; component examples and documentation.
          </p>
